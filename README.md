Hi there!

After a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science with a focus on music technology and during my Master degree in Media Informatics, I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, software engineering and web design aiming to be hired in 2022.
This repository is for completed projects and code snippets from various Data Science classes. 

I've learned, practiced and successfully applied following skills & topics:

- Command Line Commands
- Learn Git Course
- Python 3
- Python Objects and Classes
- Linear Data Structures
- Complex Data Structures
- Asymptotic Notation
- Recursion with Python
- Numpy Basic Concepts [Example 1](https://github.com/Haferkorn/DataScience_Portfolio/blob/main/Numpy.ipynb) [Example 2](https://github.com/Haferkorn/DataScience_Portfolio/blob/main/Numpy/Mean_Variance_Standard_Deviation_Calculator.ipynb)
- SQL
- Data Acquisition
- Web Scraping
- Data Manipulation with Pandas [Example 1](https://github.com/Haferkorn/DataScience_Portfolio/tree/main/Pandas/Country_Analysis) [Example 2](https://github.com/Haferkorn/DataScience_Portfolio/tree/main/Pandas/Country_Analysis)
- Data Wrangling and Tidying
- Hypothesis Testing
- Data Visualization
- Natural Language Processing
- Foundations of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning
- Foundations of Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning
- Foundations of Deep Learning

List of projects:

- [Hurricane Analysis Challenge](https://github.com/Haferkorn/DataScience_Portfolio/blob/main/projects/hurricaneAnalysis.py) (Python): This project aimed to use the basics of Python programming (dictionaries, loops, conditionals, etc.) to analyze data and put it into context.
